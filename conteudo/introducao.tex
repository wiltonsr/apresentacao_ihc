\begin{block}{Why the Aalborg beamer theme?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> In August 2010, I gave a presentation at the European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO) here in Aalborg. For that purpose, I created the AAU sidebar beamer theme.
    \item<2-> Since there was no Aalborg University (AAU) branded beamer theme, I published the theme after the conference on my website so that other researches and students at AAU could use the theme for their presentations.
    \item<3-> I have received a lot of positive feedback. To my surprise, several people not affiliated with AAU have used the theme despite the heavy AAU branding.
    \item<4-> To make the theme more usable to people not affiliated with AAU, I have decided to create this theme called \alert{Aalborg} which is very similar to the AAU sidebar theme, but it does not come with the heavy AAU branding.
  \end{itemize}
